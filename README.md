## Description
The present project seeks to design both software and hardware for a communication system based on facial recognition In this design, the use of ACAT and an infrared sensor connected by USB or Jack to the computer will be incorporated to obtain the necessary information that through an algorithm would serve as means of selecting the appropriate actions to obtain as output the message to be transmitted.

## Desing

- Based on the study of the operation of the ACAT software will establish the best sensor for people with motor neuron diseases and other disabilities
- The method of data acquisition will be designed by conditioning the signal sent by the sensor.
- The best microprocessed system will be selected to obtain the signal generated by the sensor
- The system of sending the acquired signal to the ACAT software will be established

### ATMEGA 328P

Once the acquired data has been conditioned, the signal is digitized by means of a microprocessor which is the ATMEGA 328p. The selection of the microprocessor was made based on the type of signal acquired and also the USART communication is required to send the data to The software ACAT.

### Infrared Sensor TCRT5000

In the market there is a large amount of infrared sensor but for our project the infrared sensor tcrt5000 has been selected for its low cost and high adaptability to our requirements.

### LiquidCrystal

In order to visualize the interface the LCD 20x4 is used.

### HC-05

To send the digitized data from the microprocessor to the computer, the bluetooth device HC05 will be used in asynchronous master slave communication.
